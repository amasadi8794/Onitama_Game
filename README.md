#Onitama Game

Onitama is a completely abstract two-player game with a random starting layout. On a 5x5 board, both players start the game with five pieces in their possession, with the main piece (the grand master) in the middle of the first row. Each player has two cards, each of which represents a possible move for each of his pieces. There is also a fifth card that cannot be used by any of the players.

On a player's turn, he chooses one of his cards. He moves one of his pieces according to the selected card. Then he replaces the card he used with the fifth card. The other player then chooses one of their cards, moves accordingly, and exchanges that card with this fifth card. Of course, this is the same card that the first player used. If the destination of the movement is on the place of one of the opponent's pawns, that pawn is out of the game. Capturing the opponent's grandmaster, or bringing your grandmaster to the main space of the opponent's piece, will make you win this game.
